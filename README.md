# Breeding-Strategy-Simulator

Purpose of this program is to simulate a given breeding strategy using a population with a genetic architecture set up by the user.  There are a multitude of user adjustable inputs, cross design strategies, and selection methods which can be implemented over 10 generations.

breeding.simulator.R contains the source functions which run the simulator

create.base.populations.R - will create multiple base populations in order to use as input to simulator

extract.results folder contains scripts to extract the results from the run.simulator output

run.simulator folder contains scripts to run the simulator with each founder population and a given strategy
