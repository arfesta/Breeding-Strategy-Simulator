# SimBreeder
Purpose of this program is to simulate a given breeding strategy using a population with a genetic architecture set up by the user.  There are a multitude of user adjustable inputs, cross design strategies, and selection methods which can be implemented over 10 generations.

# Main files:
breeding.simulator.R - ontains the source functions which run the simulator

create.base.populations.R - will create multiple base populations in order to use as input to simulator

# Extract results folder:
  contains scripts to extract the results from the run.simulator output

# Run simulator folder:
  contains scripts to run the simulator with each founder population and a given strategy
